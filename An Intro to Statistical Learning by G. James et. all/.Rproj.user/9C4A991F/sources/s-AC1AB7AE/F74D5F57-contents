```

## 2.3.1 Basic Commands
```{r}
#Create a list
x <- c(1,3,2,5)
print(x)
#Lists can be easily written over
x = c(1,6,2)
print(x)
#Another list
y = c(1,4,3)
print(y)
#Query list property such as length
length(x)
length(y)
#Add the lists
x+y
#Now clear the lists from the variables 
ls()
rm(x,y)
ls()

#Intro to matrices
x=matrix(data=c(1,2,3,4), nrow=2, ncol=2)
print(x)
#or
matrix(c(4,3,2,1),2,2,byrow=TRUE) #not assigned to a variable 
#Perform operations on matrices
sqrt(x)
x^2


x=rnorm(50) #Generate a random samples of (n=50) with a normal distribution
y=x+rnorm(50, mean=50, sd=.1) #Generates another random sample of 50 with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of .1)
cor(x,y) #Compute the correlation between the two randomly generated samples

#Generate another random sample of 50
set.seed(1303) #seeds allow results to be reporducable
rnorm(50)

#Generates a new random sample that can be reproduced by another user and perform operations on the sample to find its mean, variance, and standard deviation.
set.seed(3)
y=rnorm(100)
mean(y)
var(y)
sqrt(var(y)) #Mathematical way of calculating the standard deviation
sd(y) #but there is a built in function for that
```

## 2.3.2 Graphics
```{r}
x=rnorm(100)
y=rnorm(100)
plot(x,y)
plot(x,y,xlab="this is the x-axis",ylab="this is the y-axis", main = "Plot of X vs Y")
```
